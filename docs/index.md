## Blendic SVG

Blendic SVG is Free Software.  

Blendic SVG helps you make kinematic animation based on armatures, bones, constrains and keyframes like Blender. Bones and constrains, such as IK, make it easier to create complex character animations. Without these tools, your work would be  tough.  
Blendic SVG is also specialized to SVG, so you can attach kinematic animation to your original SVG and export it as SVG with CSS animation like here.
